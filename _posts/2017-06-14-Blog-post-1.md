**Blog week 1: Designing our website**

The main focus of our lesson was to restart the creation of our website, I faced a few problems with the coding but mostly the lesson ran smoothly. During the lesson I managed to; successfully create a new GitHub repository, create my website and change its aesthetics, All of which I achieved during the lesson.
